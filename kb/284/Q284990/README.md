## Q284990: XCON: Inbound SMTP Message Contains Extra Line in Message Body

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	Inbound Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages may contain an extra blank
	line after a carriage-return/line-feed combination in the message body. This
	problem can occur if the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) header
	content-type has a value of text/enriched and if there are Hypertext Markup
	Language (HTML) tags in the message body. This problem occurs only when you view
	the message with Microsoft Outlook 2000, not when you view the message with any
	earlier version of Outlook.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This problem occurs because the text/enriched content-type causes the message to
	go through a Rich Text Format (RTF) parser. The RTF parser adds a new paragraph
	symbol at the end of a line, and also retains the end of one combination of
	carriage-return/line-feed. This problem is usually resolved later, but in this
	scenario, it is not.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
	correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
	systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
	testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
	are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
	for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.
	
	To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
	to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
	phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

	NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
	be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
	update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
	support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
	question.
